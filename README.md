#  Hey There! I'm Sean! 


## Good to see you! ðŸŽ†![visitors](https://visitor-badge.glitch.me/badge?page_id=page.id)ðŸŽ†

I am a (stop me if you've heard this before) full stack web developser. I enjoy writing code, looking at code, talking about code and pretty much anything dealing with software since I love understanding how it all works!  

I have a pretty good eye for seeing how things work and love to think about design or user interfeaces (UX).
